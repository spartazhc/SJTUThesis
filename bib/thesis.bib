abstract={The current state-of-the-art for standardized video codecs is High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) which was developed jointly by ISO/IEC and ITU-T. Recently, the development of two contenders for the next generation of standardized video codecs began: ISO/IEC and ITU-T advance the development of the Joint Exploration Model (JEM), a possible successor of HEVC, while the Alliance for Open Media pushes forward the video codec AV1. It is asserted by both groups that their codecs achieve superior coding efficiency over the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we discuss the distinguishing features of JEM and AV1 and evaluate their coding efficiency and computational complexity under well-defined and balanced test conditions. Our main findings are that JEM considerably outperforms HM and AV1 in terms of coding efficiency while AV1 cannot transform increased complexity into competitiveness in terms of coding efficiency with neither of the competitors except for the all-intra configuration.},

abstract={The growing requirements for broadcasting and streaming of high quality video continue to trigger demands for codecs with higher compression efficiency. AV1 is the most recent open and royalty free video coding specification developed by Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) with a declared ambition of becoming the most popular next generation video coding standard. Primary alternatives to AV1 are the VP9 and the HEVC/H.265 which are currently among the most popular and widespread video codecs used in applications. VP9 is also a royalty free and open specification similar to AV1, while HEVC/H.265 requires specific licensing terms for its use in commercial products and services. In this paper, we compare AV1 to VP9 and HEVC/H.265 from rate distortion point of view in a broadcasting use case scenario. Mutual comparison is performed by means of subjective evaluations carried out in a controlled environment using HD video content with typical bitrates ranging from low to high, corresponding to very low up to completely transparent quality. We then proceed with an in-depth analysis of advantages and drawbacks of each codec for specific types of content and compare the subjective comparisons and conclusions to those obtained by others in the state of the art as well to those measured by means of objective metrics such as PSNR.},

However, encoding complexity is extremely high by selecting best mode among new features.

abstract={The AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) standard can achieve considerable compression efficiency thanks to the usage of many advanced tools and improvements, such as advanced inter-prediction modes. However, these come at the cost of high computational complexity of encoder, which may limit the benefits of the standard in practical applications. This paper shows that not all sequences benefit from using all such modes, which indicates that a number of encoder optimisations can be introduced to speed up AV1 encoding. A method based on decision trees is proposed to selectively decide whether to test all inter modes. Appropriate features are extracted and used to perform the decision for each block. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the encoding time on average by 43.4\% with limited impact on the coding efficiency.},

abstract={Due to differences in frame structure, existing multi-rate video encoding algorithms cannot be directly adapted to encoders utilizing special reference frames such as AV1 without introducing substantial rate-distortion loss. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel bayesian block structure inference model inspired by a modification to an HEVC-based algorithm. It estimates the posterior probabilistic distributions of block partitioning, and adapts early terminations in the RDO procedure accordingly. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides flexibility for controlling the tradeoff between speed and coding efficiency, and can achieve an average time saving of 36.1\% (up to 50.6\%) with negligible bitrate cost.},

abstract={The widely used adaptive HTTP streaming requires an efficient algorithm to encode the same video to different resolutions. In this paper, we propose a fast block structure determination algorithm based on the AV1 codec that accelerates high resolution encoding, which is the bottle-neck of multiple resolutions encoding. The block structure similarity across resolutions is modeled by the fineness of frame detail and scale of object motions, this enables us to accelerate high resolution encoding based on low resolution encoding results. The average depth of a block's co-located neighborhood is used to decide early termination in the RDO process. Encoding results show that our proposed algorithm reduces encoding time by 30.1\%-36.8\%, while keeping BD-rate low at 0.71\%-1.04\%. Comparing to the state-of-the-art, our method halves performance loss without sacrificing time savings.},
