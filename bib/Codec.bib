  abstract = {The AV1 codec recently released by the Alliance of Open Media provides nearly 30\% BDrate reduction over its predecessor VP9. It substantially extends the available coding block sizes and supports a wide range of prediction modes. There are also a large variety of transform kernel types and sizes. The combination provides an extremely wide range of flexible coding options. To translate such flexibility into compression efficiency, the encoder needs to conduct an extensive search over the space of coding modes. Optimization of the encoder complexity and compression efficiency trade-off is critical to productionizing AV1. Many research efforts have been devoted to devising feature space based pruning methods ranging from decision rules based on some simple observations to more complex neural network models. A multi-pass coding mode search framework is proposed in this work to provide a structural approach to reduce the search volume. It decomposes the original high dimensional space search into cascaded stages of lower dimensional space searches. To retain a near optimal search result, the scheme departs from conventional dimension reduction approach in which one retains a single winner at each stage, and uses that winner for the next stage (dimension). Instead, this framework retains a subset of the states that are the most likely winners at each stage, which are then fed into the next stage to find the next subset of winners. The subset size at each stage is determined by the likelihood that the optimal route will be captured in the current stage. Changing this likelihood parameter tunes the encoder for speed and compression performance trade-off. This framework can integrate with most existing feature based methods at its various stages. The framework provides 60\% encoding time reduction at the expense of 0.6\% compression loss in libaom AV1 encoder.},

However, maintaining the encoding time per frame or group of pictures (GOPs) below an adjustable upper bound is still an open research issue. A solution for this problem is devised in this paper based on a set of Pareto-efficient encoding configurations, identified through rate-distortion-complexity analysis. The proposed method combines a medium-granularity encoding time control with a fine-granularity encoding time control to accurately limit the HEVC encoding time below a predefined target for each GOP. It is shown that the encoding time can be kept below a desired target for a wide range of encoding time reductions, e.g., up to 90\% in comparison with the original encoder. The results also show that compression efficiency loss (Bjøntegaard delta-rate) varies from negligible (0.16\%) to moderate (9.83\%) in the extreme case of 90\% computational complexity reduction.},

This paper shows that, even though the computational complexity increases monotonically from the baseline to the most complex configuration, the encoding efficiency saturates at some point. Moreover, the results of this paper provide relevant information for implementation of complexity-constrained encoders by taking into account the tradeoff between complexity and coding efficiency.

This paper shows that not all sequences benefit from using all such modes, which indicates that a number of encoder optimisations can be introduced to speed up AV1 encoding. A method based on decision trees is proposed to selectively decide whether to test all inter modes. Appropriate features are extracted and used to perform the decision for each block. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the encoding time on average by 43.4\% with limited impact on the coding efficiency.},

AV1 gained a lot in terms of coding efficiency compared to previous versions and now outperforms HM by 24\% BD-Rate gains. VTM gains 5\% over AV1 in terms of BD-Rates.

To meet the growing demands of screen content coding, the emerging AV1 video codec incorporates several coding tools, which are specially designed for screen content utilizing its distinctive characteristics. Among these tools, the intra block copy utilizes the characteristic that repeating patterns frequently occur in screen content. This paper presents the technology of intra block copy in AV1. In particular, to efficiently search the predictor in the reconstructed regions of the current picture, AV1 uses the hash matching method at the encoder side. For the generation of hash table, a bottom-to-up manner is adopted to reduce the redundant computation and then decrease the encoding time. In addition, several constraints are involved to facilitate hardware design. Experimental results demonstrate that the intra block copy in AV1 can bring 27.1\% bitrate saving for screen content. When compared with the non hash-based intra block copy, the hash-based method achieves 12.2\% bitrate saving.},

At the encoder, an autoregressive model of film grain is transmitted relative to a denoised signal, and the film grain strength is modeled as a function of intensity. The corresponding renoising at the decoder is implemented using an efficient block-based approach suitable for use in consumer electronic devices.

  abstract = {With the finalization of the AVI specification, the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) has set high expectations for it. The prospect of a royalty-free alternative to high efficiency video coding (HEVC) has many supporters in the industry, particularly those seeking a standard for streaming applications that is optimized for over-the-top (OTT) delivery quite excited. Fundamental to AV1’s success will be the transfer of a toolset of efficient software implementations that can deliver the expected performance over existing compression standards within the constraints of future server provision. Efficient implementations of AV1 will require a careful balance between utilizing bespoke processor features to offload demanding processor-intensive functions and the desire to have a platform-agnostic compression standard that can be applied across a wide range of infrastructures. As with all complex compression schemes, realizing a software mapping of the toolset is crucial. This is true for AV1, which, being royalty-free, utilizes algorithms and methods that are different from those used in the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) suite of standards. This article will look at the application challenges facing AV1 and compare its objective performance to that of the HEVC in terms of bitrate efficiency and encode time.},

The existing pixel-based JND models mainly consider the orderly factors and always underestimate the JND threshold of the disorderly region. Recent research indicates that the human visual system (HVS) actively predicts the orderly information and avoids the residual disorderly uncertainty for image perception and understanding. Thus, we suggest that there exists disorderly concealment effect which results in high JND threshold of the disorderly region. Beginning with the Bayesian inference, we deduce an autoregressive model to imitate the active prediction of the HVS. Then, we estimate the disorderly concealment effect for the novel JND model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed JND model outperforms the relevant existing ones. Furthermore, we apply the proposed JND model in image compression, and around 15\% of bit rate can be reduced without jeopardizing the perceptual quality.},

Based on this framework, context prediction algorithms that use same data dependency model as previous works in H.264 and HEVC are implemented. Furthermore, we proposed an optimal context prediction algorithm specifically for AV1. Experimental results showed that our framework with proposed optimal algorithm yields good parallelism and scalability (over 10x speed-up with 16 threads for 4k sequences) with little coding performance loss (less than 0.2\% bitrate increasing).},

  abstract = {AV1 is the next-generation open video coding format, and it can achieve significant coding efficiency with novel coding tools. It supports Lagrangian rate distortion optimization (RDO) method to optimize the coding performance. However, the distortion and the Lagrangian multiplier used in RDO ignore the characteristics of human visual system (HVS), which leads to insufficiency for perceptual video coding. To solve this problem, a perceptual RDO scheme based on the Just Noticeable Distortion (JND) threshold of HVS is proposed. The JND for each pixel is first measured according to three perceptual features: luminance adaptation, masking effects and structure sensitivity. Based on the observation that the regions with smaller distortion visibility thresholds are more sensitive to HVS, a JND-based Lagrangian multiplier is derived to adaptively adjust the rate-distortion (RD) performance for each coding block. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve an average SSIM-based -3.93\% BD-Rate saving compared with the original AV1 encoder, which effectively improve the coding performance.},
